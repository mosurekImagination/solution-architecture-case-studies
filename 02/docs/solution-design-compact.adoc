== Executive Summary

=== Context

An established European international webshop chain (15 years on the market, ~1M daily customers) selling groceries and commodity goods wants to increase turnover by 20%. The client operates a WordPress-based e-commerce platform and a separate outsourced mobile application, with customer data scattered across isolated systems ("islands of information"). They seek to become "AI enabled and data enabled" by building a unified data pipeline that consolidates customer, product, and wholesaler data to power a personalized product suggestion mechanism — initially delivered via email, with mobile push notifications as a secondary channel.

=== Recommendation at a Glance

|**Estimated OPEX**
|❓ $8K–$20K/month (Snowflake + ESP + infrastructure)

|**Timeline**
|6–10 months (phased delivery)

|**Team Size**
|4–6 engineers (2 Data Engineers + 1 Backend + 1 ML/Data Scientist + 1 QA + 0.5 SA)

|**Go-Live Target**

|===

=== Key Decisions Required

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
|# |Decision |Needed By

|1
|Approve recommended option and budget envelope
|Before Phase 1 kickoff

|2
|Confirm cloud provider (AWS assumed — impacts Snowflake deployment)
|Week 1

|3
|Initiate data access negotiation with mobile app vendor
|Immediately (critical path)

|4
|Confirm GDPR consent status for email marketing
|Before email campaign launch

|5
|Identify internal team members for knowledge transfer and ownership
|Before Phase 1 kickoff
|===

== Problem & Vision

=== Current Pain Points

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
|# |Problem |Business Impact

|1
|Customer data scattered across isolated systems (WordPress DB, mobile app, wholesaler feeds) — no unified view
|Cannot identify cross-channel buying patterns; personalization impossible

|2
|No mechanism to proactively suggest products to existing customers
|~1M daily customers but no re-engagement; revenue limited to organic visits

|3
|Mobile app data locked behind external vendor (email-gated access)
|Mobile customer behavior invisible; cannot target app users with offers

|4
|15 years of accumulated customer emails — many stale or invalid (10-minute mailboxes)
|Email marketing campaign ROI degraded by poor deliverability

|5
|Internal team lacks data engineering expertise to build analytics capabilities
|Data-driven decisions delayed; business relies on intuition over evidence
|===

=== Target State

The enterprise has a unified data platform that continuously consolidates customer, product, and wholesaler data from all sources into a single analytical store. A personalized suggestion engine analyzes buying patterns and matches customers with relevant products and deals, delivering timely recommendations via email and mobile push. The marketing team monitors campaign performance through self-service dashboards, and the platform is designed for the internal team to gradually take ownership with minimal external dependency.

== Recommended Option: Snowflake Data Platform with Managed ETL

=== What It Delivers

* Unified analytical data store (Snowflake) consolidating WordPress, mobile, and wholesaler data
* Automated ETL pipeline with data quality validation and email address verification
* ML-based customer segmentation and personalized product recommendation engine
* Personalized email campaign delivery via managed ESP integration
* Mobile push notification capability (Phase 2, pending vendor cooperation)
* Self-service analytics dashboard for marketing team (campaign performance, KPIs)
* GDPR-compliant data processing with consent management

=== Business Value

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===
|Value Driver |Current Cost / Pain |Expected Improvement

|Untapped customer data
|15 years of data in silos, zero personalization
|Unified customer view → targeted suggestions → +20% turnover target

|No re-engagement channel
|Customers visit organically only
|Proactive email suggestions → repeat purchases → higher LTV

|Stale email database
|Unknown % of invalid emails, no validation
|Email validation → improved deliverability → reduced bounce costs

|Manual / no analytics
|Business decisions based on intuition
|Self-service dashboards → data-driven decisions → faster iteration
|===

**Estimated payback period:** ❓ ~6-9 months after go-live (if 20% uplift achieved, offset of platform cost depends on revenue per customer)

=== Pros & Cons

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Pros |Cons

|Snowflake is mature, well-documented, popular on AWS — strong community and hiring pool
|Snowflake license cost scales with usage — unpredictable at high query volumes

|Managed service reduces operational burden — fits non-technical internal team
|Vendor lock-in risk — Snowflake is proprietary

|Phased delivery reduces risk — can deliver value (email channel) within 3-4 months
|Mobile vendor cooperation is uncertain — Phase 2 may be blocked or delayed

|Covers all three data sources — provides the unified view the client needs
|Data quality of 15-year-old records is unknown — cleaning effort may be substantial

|Extensible to AI/ML workloads in future (Snowpark, external ML tools)
|Requires data engineering expertise — client team needs training/hiring
|===

== Risks & Assumptions

=== Key Risks

[cols="2,1,1,3"]
|===
|Risk |Likelihood |Impact |Mitigation

|Mobile vendor refuses or delays data access
|Medium
|High
|Start vendor negotiation immediately; design Phase 1 without mobile data; prepare contractual fallback (data export clause)

|Customer email data quality is worse than expected (>50% invalid)
|Medium
|High
|Run email validation early (Phase 1, Week 2); adjust channel strategy if email reach is too low; prioritize mobile channel earlier

|GDPR consent gaps — insufficient marketing consent for email campaigns
|Medium
|High
|Audit consent records in WordPress DB during discovery; build consent collection flow if needed (delays email launch)

|Snowflake costs exceed estimates at production data volumes
|Low
|Medium
|Set usage alerts and budgets; optimize query patterns; consider Snowflake auto-suspend for non-peak hours

|Wholesaler data not available or inconsistent formats
|Medium
|Medium
|Design pipeline to work without wholesaler data initially; add wholesaler connectors incrementally

|Scope creep — client wants WordPress migration or full platform rebuild
|Medium
|Medium
|Clear scope boundary in contract; separate ADR for any migration discussion; redirect to future phase
|===

=== Key Assumptions

* WordPress DB uses MySQL/MariaDB with standard WooCommerce-compatible schema
* Client will provision cloud account (AWS) before Phase 1 kickoff
* GDPR consent exists for at least a portion of the customer base for marketing emails
* The 20% turnover increase target is realistic with personalization (needs market research validation)
* Client will assign at least 1-2 internal team members for knowledge transfer and eventual ownership
* Mobile vendor will cooperate with data export within 2-3 months (contractual negotiation)

=== Key Dependencies

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===
|Dependency |Owner |Needed By

|AWS account provisioned with admin access
|Client IT
|Phase 1 kickoff

|WordPress DB access credentials (read replica)
|Client IT / DBA
|Phase 1 Week 1

|Mobile vendor data access negotiation initiated
|Client (contract owner)
|Immediately

|GDPR consent audit results
|Client Legal / DPO
|Phase 1 Week 2

|Wholesaler data sharing agreement (at least 1 wholesaler)
|Client (wholesaler relationship manager)
|Phase 2 start

|Internal team members identified for knowledge transfer
|Client leadership

== Executive Summary

=== Context

An established European international webshop chain (15 years on the market, ~1M daily customers, 2M mobile app installs) selling groceries and commodity goods wants to increase turnover by 20%. The client operates a WordPress-based e-commerce platform (900GB heavily-customized MySQL, hosted on-prem) and a separate outsourced mobile application (external vendor with APIs and own database), with customer data scattered across isolated systems ("islands of information"). They seek to become "AI enabled and data enabled" by building a unified data pipeline that consolidates customer, product, and wholesaler data to power a personalized product suggestion mechanism — delivered via email (AWS SES) and mobile push notifications. The client has no data team, no plans to hire, and no existing expertise — the solution must be simple enough to learn and eventually own.

=== Key Decisions Required

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
|# |Decision |Needed By

|1
|Approve recommended option and budget envelope
|Before Phase 1 kickoff

|2
|~~Confirm cloud provider~~ → **RESOLVED:** AWS confirmed (hybrid with on-prem hosting); VPN/Direct Connect required
|Week 1

|3
|Initiate API access negotiation with mobile app vendor (APIs confirmed; need docs, auth, rate limits)
|Immediately (critical path)

|4
|~~Confirm GDPR consent status~~ → **RESOLVED:** GDPR consent confirmed (yes)
|~~Before email campaign launch~~

|5
|Identify internal team members for knowledge transfer and ownership
|Before Phase 1 kickoff
|===

== Problem & Vision

=== Current Pain Points

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
|# |Problem |Business Impact

|1
|Customer data scattered across isolated systems (WordPress DB, mobile app, wholesaler feeds) — no unified view
|Cannot identify cross-channel buying patterns; personalization impossible

|2
|No mechanism to proactively suggest products to existing customers
|~1M daily customers but no re-engagement; revenue limited to organic visits

|3
|Mobile app data accessible via vendor APIs (DB also available on request), but 2M installs = primary channel data missing from analytics
|Mobile customer behavior invisible; cannot target 2M app users with personalized offers

|4
|15 years of accumulated customer emails — many stale or invalid (10-minute mailboxes)
|Email marketing campaign ROI degraded by poor deliverability

|5
|Internal team lacks data engineering expertise to build analytics capabilities
|Data-driven decisions delayed; business relies on intuition over evidence
|===

=== Target State

The enterprise has a unified data platform that continuously consolidates customer, product, and wholesaler data from all sources into a single analytical store. A personalized suggestion engine analyzes buying patterns and matches customers with relevant products and deals, delivering timely recommendations via email and mobile push. The marketing team monitors campaign performance through self-service dashboards, and the platform is designed for the internal team to gradually take ownership with minimal external dependency.

== Recommended Option: Snowflake Data Platform with Managed ETL

=== What It Delivers

* Unified analytical data store (Snowflake) consolidating WordPress, mobile, and wholesaler data
* Automated ETL pipeline with data quality validation and email address verification
* ML-based customer segmentation and personalized product recommendation engine
* Personalized email campaign delivery via **AWS SES** (already in use)
* Mobile push notification capability (Phase 2 — 2M installs makes this a **primary channel**)
* Self-service analytics dashboard for marketing team (campaign performance, KPIs)
* GDPR-compliant data processing with consent management

=== Business Value

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===
|Value Driver |Current Cost / Pain |Expected Improvement

|Untapped customer data
|15 years of data in silos, zero personalization
|Unified customer view → targeted suggestions → +20% turnover target

|No re-engagement channel
|Customers visit organically only
|Proactive email suggestions → repeat purchases → higher LTV

|Stale email database
|Unknown % of invalid emails, no validation
|Email validation → improved deliverability → reduced bounce costs

|Manual / no analytics
|Business decisions based on intuition
|Self-service dashboards → data-driven decisions → faster iteration
|===

**Estimated payback period:** ❓ ~6-9 months after go-live (if 20% uplift achieved, offset of platform cost depends on revenue per customer)

=== Pros & Cons

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Pros |Cons

|Snowflake is mature, well-documented, popular on AWS — strong community and hiring pool
|Snowflake license cost scales with usage — unpredictable at high query volumes

|Managed service reduces operational burden — fits non-technical internal team
|Vendor lock-in risk — Snowflake is proprietary

|Phased delivery reduces risk — can deliver value (email channel) within 3-4 months
|Mobile vendor cooperation is uncertain — Phase 2 may be blocked or delayed

|Covers all three data sources — provides the unified view the client needs
|Data quality of 15-year-old records is unknown — cleaning effort may be substantial

|Extensible to AI/ML workloads in future (Snowpark, external ML tools)
|Requires data engineering expertise — client team needs training/hiring
|===

== Risks & Assumptions

=== Key Risks

[cols="2,1,1,3"]
|===
|Risk |Likelihood |Impact |Mitigation

|Mobile vendor refuses or delays data access
|Low
|High
|**Risk reduced:** APIs confirmed; DB available on request. ADR-002 recommends hybrid approach (API for ongoing + periodic DB export for backfill). If vendor refuses export, fall back to API-only. Negotiate terms via questions-002 Q4-Q5.

|Customer email data quality is worse than expected (>50% invalid)
|Medium
|High
|Run email validation early (Phase 1, Week 2); adjust channel strategy if email reach is too low; mobile push is a viable fallback (2M installs)

|~~GDPR consent gaps~~
|~~Medium~~
|~~High~~
|**RESOLVED:** GDPR consent confirmed (yes). No consent collection flow needed.

|Snowflake costs exceed estimates at production data volumes
|Low
|Medium
|Set usage alerts and budgets; optimize query patterns; consider Snowflake auto-suspend for non-peak hours

|Wholesaler data not available or inconsistent formats
|High
|Medium
|Client confirmed "everything, no standard" — high format variability. ADR-002 recommends S3 file landing zone with Snowflake schema-on-read (VARIANT columns) + per-supplier dbt models. Start with 1-2 wholesalers. See questions-002 Q6.

|WordPress 900GB heavily-customized schema — ETL requires custom extraction logic
|High
|High
|**NEW RISK:** No off-the-shelf CDC connectors work. ADR-002 recommends direct SQL extraction via VPN (extracting only the analytical subset ~10-30% of tables). Schema reverse-engineering via table inventory (questions-002 Q1). If >80% of tables needed, ADR-002 provides upgrade path to MySQL→RDS replication.

|No internal team to take ownership — capability building with no recipient
|High
|High
|**NEW RISK:** No data team, no plans, no expertise. Knowledge transfer has no recipient. Must build capability from scratch alongside platform delivery. Factor training into every phase.

|Scope creep — client wants WordPress migration or full platform rebuild
|Medium
|Medium
|Clear scope boundary in contract; separate ADR for any migration discussion; redirect to future phase
|===

=== Key Assumptions

* WordPress DB is MySQL, **900GB, heavily customized** (not standard WooCommerce) — requires custom SQL extraction (ADR-002)
* Client uses **AWS for some services**; WordPress hosted **on-prem** — VPN/Direct Connect required
* **GDPR consent confirmed (yes)** — email campaigns can launch without consent collection
* The 20% turnover increase target is realistic with personalization (needs market research validation)
* **No data team, no plans, no expertise** — "be the change"; solution must include capability building
* Mobile vendor has **APIs and DB available on request** — API access terms need negotiation (questions-002)

=== Key Dependencies

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===
|Dependency |Owner |Needed By

|AWS account — partially in use; VPN/Direct Connect setup needed for on-prem → AWS
|Client IT
|Phase 1 kickoff

|WordPress DB read access (read replica recommended — see ADR-002, questions-002 Q1, Q3)
|Client IT / DBA
|Phase 1 Week 1

|Mobile vendor API documentation, auth method, rate limits + periodic DB export agreement
|Client (contract owner)
|Phase 1 Week 2 (see ADR-002, questions-002 Q4-Q5)

|~~GDPR consent audit results~~
|~~Client Legal / DPO~~
|**RESOLVED** — consent confirmed

|VPN/Direct Connect between on-prem data center and AWS VPC
|Client IT + AWS
|Phase 1 Week 2 (critical path for WordPress ingestion)

|Wholesaler data sharing agreement + sample files from 2-3 suppliers (see questions-002 Q6)
|Client (wholesaler relationship manager)
|Phase 2 start

|Internal team members identified for knowledge transfer
|Client leadership
|Phase 1 kickoff — **critical: no data team exists**

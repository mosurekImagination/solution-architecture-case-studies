- DO NOT THROW QUESTION IN FRONT OF CLIENT
provide assumption and then ask to verify or deny it
"is suppose that your application will be popular -> we need to scale it"
- PROOF or eligibility
there are two options - pick one.
if you have hundred open questions -> client might get bored etc.
you need to balance the number of them.

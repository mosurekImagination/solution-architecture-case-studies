# Discovery Questions Template

> **Purpose:** Structured list of questions for async or meeting-based discovery with a client
> or stakeholder. Designed for easy reading and answering — one question at a time.
>
> **Usage:**
> 1. Copy this template into your project: `<case>/questionnaire/discovery-questions.md`
> 2. Pre-fill the **Context** column so the respondent knows *why* you're asking
> 3. Send to the stakeholder — they fill in the **Answer** column
> 4. After answers arrive, update the questionnaire and solution design accordingly
>
> **Priority Tags:**
> - 🔴 **Blocker** — blocks architecture decisions; answer needed before design work
> - 🟡 **Important** — shapes the solution significantly; can assume a default temporarily
> - 🟢 **Nice to have** — improves design quality; can proceed without it
>
> **Tips:**
> - Keep questions short and specific — one topic per question
> - Provide your assumption so the respondent can *correct* rather than *create*
> - Group by topic for easy navigation
> - Mark which questions can be answered by different people (not everyone knows everything)

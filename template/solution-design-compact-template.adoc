// ============================================================================
// COMPACT SOLUTION DESIGN — ~15 minute client meeting format
// ============================================================================
//
// PURPOSE: Decision-oriented document for stakeholder meetings.
//   Covers WHAT we recommend, WHY, HOW MUCH, and WHEN.
//   Omits deep technical sections (security, API, observability, etc.)
//   that belong in the full solution-design-template.adoc.
//
// MEETING TIPS:
//   - Start with the recommendation, not the problem. Executives want the
//     answer first, then the justification. Lead with §1, deep-dive only if asked.
//   - Print/share this doc BEFORE the meeting. Never surprise stakeholders
//     with costs or timelines they haven't had time to digest.
//   - Keep one slide per section — the "one-screen test". If a section
//     doesn't fit on one screen, it's too detailed for this format.
//   - Reserve 5 min for questions — the real meeting happens there.
//
// SECTIONS (8 total):
//   §1  Executive Summary ......... 2 min — context + recommendation
//   §2  Problem & Vision .......... 2 min — pain points + target state
//   §3  Solution Overview ......... 2 min — C4 context + architecture
//   §4  Options Comparison ........ 3 min — side-by-side + cost chart
//   §5  Recommended Option ........ 2 min — detail on the winner
//   §6  Risks & Assumptions ....... 2 min — what could go wrong
//   §7  Timeline .................. 1 min — Gantt
//   §8  Next Steps & Decisions .... 1 min — actions needed from client
//
// DIAGRAMS (4 total — all via Kroki):
//   1× Structurizr  — C4 System Context
//   1× Vega-Lite    — Cost comparison chart
//   1× PlantUML     — Timeline Gantt
//   1× D2           — Component architecture (recommended option)
//
// COMPANION: For technical deep-dives, refer to the full
//   solution-design-template.adoc (25 sections, 16 diagrams).
//
// STEPS:
//   1. Replace all [bracketed placeholders] with your project details
//   2. Render: npx asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-kroki solution-design-compact.adoc
//   3. Requires: docker-compose up -d (Kroki + PlantUML server)
//

== Recommended Option: [Option Name]

=== What It Delivers

* [Key deliverable 1 — e.g., Mobile app with AI-powered recommendations]
* [Key deliverable 2 — e.g., Admin portal for content management]
* [Key deliverable 3 — e.g., Analytics dashboard]

=== Business Value

// Frame cost as investment, not expense. Answer: "What do we GET for this money?"

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===
|Value Driver |Current Cost / Pain |Expected Improvement

|[e.g., Manual processes]
|[e.g., 40 hrs/week wasted]
|[e.g., 90% automation → $X/year saved]

|[e.g., Customer churn]
|[e.g., X% monthly]
|[e.g., Target < Y% with improved UX]
|===

**Estimated payback period:** [e.g., ~N months]

=== Cost Summary

// Principle: Cost = capacity × time. Show rate × duration so the client
// sees they’re buying engineering hours, not opaque line items.
// Always include contingency and pair cost with deliverables.

// ============================================================================
// ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORD (ADR)
// ============================================================================
//
// Based on Michael Nygard's ADR format with extensions for:
//   - Structured alternatives comparison
//   - Quality attribute impact analysis
//   - Cross-references to solution design sections
//
// USAGE:
//   1. Copy this template to your project's docs/adr/ directory
//   2. Name the file: adr-NNN-short-title.adoc (e.g., adr-001-use-postgresql.adoc)
//   3. Fill in all sections
//   4. Update the ADR summary table in solution-design.adoc (§ Architecture Decision Records)
//   5. Get review from stakeholders listed in "Deciders"
//
// STATUS LIFECYCLE:
//   Proposed → Accepted → [Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]
//
// REVERSIBILITY:
//   Easy     = config change, feature flag, or minor code update
//   Hard     = significant rework (weeks), but technically possible
//   One-way  = migration, data format change, or public API — cannot undo
//             → One-way decisions deserve extra scrutiny and stakeholder sign-off
//
// BORING TECHNOLOGY BIAS:
//   Unless there's a compelling, specific reason for something novel,
//   prefer mature, well-understood technology. Every new technology
//   adds operational burden and narrows your hiring pool.
//   Ask: "Is this technology essential, or just exciting?"
//
// ============================================================================

== Context

[Describe the situation that motivates this decision. What is the problem, the forces at play, the constraints? This section should be factual and neutral — do not advocate for a solution here.]

**Relevant constraints:**

* [Technical constraint — e.g., must integrate with existing SSO]
* [Business constraint — e.g., team has no Go experience]
* [Timeline constraint — e.g., must be ready for Q3 launch]

**Related sections in Solution Design:**

* [e.g., § System Context — shows where this component fits]
* [e.g., § Data Architecture — data model impacted by this choice]

== Decision

// TIP: Write the decision as if you're explaining it to a new team member
// who joins 6 months from now. They should understand not just WHAT was
// decided, but WHY — including what was explicitly rejected and why.

[State the decision clearly. Use present tense: "We will use..." or "We adopt...". Be specific about what was chosen and any conditions or parameters.]

**We will use [Technology / Pattern / Approach] because [primary reason].**

== Alternatives Considered

[cols="2,3,3,3"]
|===
|Alternative |Pros |Cons |Why Not Chosen

|**[Alternative 1]**
|[Pro 1, Pro 2]
|[Con 1, Con 2]
|[Key reason for rejection]

|**[Alternative 2]**
|[Pro 1, Pro 2]
|[Con 1, Con 2]
|[Key reason for rejection]

|**[Alternative 3]** (if applicable)
|[Pro 1, Pro 2]
|[Con 1, Con 2]
|[Key reason for rejection]

== Consequences

=== Positive

* [Benefit 1 — e.g., reduces deployment time by 50%]
* [Benefit 2 — e.g., enables horizontal scaling]
* [Benefit 3 — e.g., leverages existing team expertise]

=== Negative

* [Trade-off 1 — e.g., increased operational complexity]
* [Trade-off 2 — e.g., vendor lock-in risk]
* [Trade-off 3 — e.g., learning curve for some team members]

=== Dependency & Hiring Impact

* **Dependency accumulation risk:** [Does this decision add a new runtime dependency, external service, or vendor relationship? What happens if that dependency is discontinued or changes pricing?]
* **Hiring impact:** [Does this technology narrow or widen the hiring pool? Can the current team maintain this without the original author?]
* **Operational burden:** [What new operational skills does this require? Monitoring, upgrades, security patches?]

=== Neutral

* [Observation 1 — e.g., requires updating CI/CD pipeline]
* [Observation 2 — e.g., no impact on existing APIs]

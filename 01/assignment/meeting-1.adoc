== Project Overview

=== Client Need

A mobile tourist application with the following core features:

==== Primary Function
* Take a photo of an attraction (landmark, scenery, etc.)
* Receive description via voice-over and/or text
* Replaces the current flow of: photo → ChatGPT/Wikipedia → manual search

==== Secondary Function - Partnership Ecosystem
* Advertise partner businesses near attractions
* Example: Photo of Eiffel Tower → description + recommendation for partner cafeteria nearby
* Partners are *NOT* random businesses but signed partners

==== Tertiary Function - Discount System
* Show QR code at partner locations
* Receive discounts when scanned

=== Scope

* Global ambitions (from famous attractions like Eiffel Tower to small local vineyards in Spain)
* Some attractions may lack Wikipedia pages
* Partners will provide their own information
* Geo-location is potentially important
* All functionality should be *within the mobile app* (no external website visits)

== Assignment Structure

=== Part 1: Questions (Due: Next Week)

*Goal:* Extract missing information through questions or assumptions

==== What's Missing

* Back-end infrastructure details
* Non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, etc.)
* How LLM integration works
* Partnership initiation and management process
* Partnership network operations
* Security guardrails and rate limiting
* What happens in edge cases (unknown attractions, spam requests, etc.)

==== Deliverable

* List of questions
* Optional: Schedule recorded Q&A session with mentor (acting as client)

=== Part 2: Solution Design (Due: Week After - ~2 weeks total)

==== Required Components

===== 1. Assumptions
Document what you're assuming since you won't have 100% information

===== 2. High-Level Component Design
* What talks to what
* Key flows and use cases
* Simple scenario: User takes photo → what happens?
* Complex scenario: User in mountain village photographs partner vineyard → what happens?

===== 3. Deep Dive on Key Areas
* Infrastructure design
* Back-end configuration
* Key integrations (especially LLM: Anthropic API? OpenAI? Self-hosted open source on EC2?)
* Rationale for technical choices

===== 4. Cost Breakdown
* *CAPEX (Capital Expenses):* Development costs (e.g., 5 developers × hourly rate × time)
* *OPEX (Operational Expenses):* Monthly recurring costs (cloud infrastructure, licenses, etc.)

===== 5. Development Milestones
* POC (Proof of Concept) - what features?
* MVP (Minimum Viable Product for App Store) - what features?
* Full-scale release - what features?
* Out of scope items
* Feature priorities
* High-level epic structure

===== 6. Business Flows
Cover various scenarios

===== 7. Additional Enhancements
You CAN propose improvements if you see gaps (e.g., security, rate limiting, etc.)

== Format Notes

* Informal structure (not a formal RFP)
* But technically complete
* Free-form document
* Reasonable complexity (achievable by engineering team in viable timeframe)

== Key Insights from Mentor

=== Question Development Approaches

. Try to design solution with available info → identify gaps → questions emerge naturally
. Push system boundaries → edge cases reveal questions
** What if no attraction found?
** What if spam?
** What if conflicting requirements?

=== Important Considerations Mentioned

* Security guardrails and rate limiting (to prevent DoS and unbearable costs)
* Client may not know all answers
* Client descriptions may be contradictory
* Your job to provide reasonable solutions and flag missing critical items

## Estimation & Costing Principles

- Estimate cost based on **effort (man-hours)**, not per module or feature.
  - Formula: `developer rate × time = cost`
- Present a **timeline with cost breakdown** so stakeholders see both schedule and budget impact.
- Identify which workstreams can run **in parallel** to shorten the critical path.
- The deliverable we sell is **capacity × time** — make this transparent.

## Visualization

- Use a **Gantt chart** to communicate:
  - Task dependencies and sequencing
  - Parallelizable workstreams
  - Overall timeline and milestones
- This helps justify duration to stakeholders ("why does it take this long?").

## Risk Management

- Always include a **risk buffer** — typically **20–50%** on top of base estimates.
- Account for **team risks (bus factor)**:
  - Assign at least **2 engineers per workstream** to avoid single points of failure.
  - Consider staffing trade-offs (e.g., 2 mid-level engineers vs. 1 senior).
- Account for **external / vendor risks**:
  - Unreliable or undocumented third-party APIs
  - Dependency on external teams or services
- **Break down risk factors explicitly** — explain why the risk level is rated low, medium, or high for each area.

## Team Scaling Considerations

- Adding more developers to a single workstream does **not** scale linearly.
- Factor in **communication overhead** (cf. Brooks's Law) before expanding a stream's team size.
